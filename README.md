# Portal Tweaks

## Features
- Cost & Fuel
- Bypass non-teleport using global keys or toggle
- Teleport tames
- Edit portal recipe
- Edit portal health

### Charge System
Using portal depletes portal charge - configurable - If 0, then it does not deplete

Charge decays over time - configurable

### Tames
If tame is following player, they will follow you through the portal - disabled by default

### Teleport Anything
Toggle to allow to teleport anything - disabled by default

### Teleport Keys
You can set global keys to items to allow teleportation

Example:
IronScrap - defeated_bonemass : to allow to teleport iron scrap after bonemass is killed

Configurations for items are generated during run-time, so modded items should appear in the configs after first load - only applies to items that are non-teleportable

### Target Portal Compatiblity
If target portal is installed - map will automatically close if not enough charge

Use charge item on portal to charge it
